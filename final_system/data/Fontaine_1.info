Parameters:
-scale 1500
-cagg 0.8
-pground 0.1
-plarge 1.0
-psmall 0.001

Noises manually removed:
Various instances of varying size leaves clusters

Notes:
The segmented ground planes intersect with noise objects and these parts still remain afterwards
-> caused by the two level ground planes due to slanting in ground plane
-> solved slightly by changing -pground to 0.1

The largest cluster is a group of leaves and is actually noise
-> solved by changing -plarge to 1.0

Trunks of trees are too often attached to the leaves
-> solved by changing -cagg to 0.8
